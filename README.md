# Hospital patient length of stay.

With a dataset focused on patient information like urgency bloodwork and other admission details that pointed towards the reason of the visit, one tries to fit a model that helps with capacity planning and optimization.

This project focused a lot on using Genetic Programming and creating and implementing operators within it, regardless of other ML models outperforming it. 
Nevertheless the following program got an average error of less than a day - about 20 hours. One can check it's tree representation and the string of the program below.

Genetic programming is a field with quite depth to it, feel free to learn about it and other symbolic methods. 

It's a good experience to build intuition about the generality of supervised AI - evolving points in function space, where its topology is known as the Loss Function for DL and as Fitness Function for Evolutionary Algorithms.

Everything in life is about tackling a specific topology at hand. Go climb the highest hills.
